          <li>Engage: The first stage focuses on engaging and engaging with all stakeholders and our partners to understand the project's vision and define the high-level business requirements within your organization. Key deliverables from this stage include understanding the high-level business requirements, proposal, and scope.</li>
          <li>Assess: During the second stage, Assessment, we work with our partners to identify and analyze all the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats surrounding our partner's intervention project, and examine how to achieve it. This stage also addresses the analysis and mitigation of risks, working with our partners.
            The main deliverables from this stage are the business requirements document, statement of work, and project action plan.
          </li>
          <li>Build: The third phase is Build. This is when we complete the assessment and analysis process, and then we begin building appropriate interventions, working in conjunction with our partners.
            The main outputs of this phase are a working document of the intervention mechanisms that have been fully built, configured, and tested, as well as supporting documentation to provide your team with full details on how the solution was created and how it will be used to achieve your objectives.</li>
          <li>Launch: In the Launch phase, the intervention plans have been reviewed and validated by our partners and are ready for launch. We will work with your teams to create an effective communication plan to manage our interventions as effectively as possible, ensuring a collaborative approach. This includes all phases of the launch, from announcing, promoting, and managing the launch, to the conclusion of the intervention. At the end of the Launch phase, you can expect to achieve your desired objectives.</li>
          <li>Evolve: The Evolve phase is the stage where we look at how to improve your interventions in the future, in the post-launch phase. The enable.ps team also looks at developing ongoing support plans as needed and necessary. At this stage, the responsibility becomes the responsibility of our IMPACT team.</li>
